USAID,"The existing carpeting in most areas of the Ronald Reagan Building (floors B1, B2, B3 and 2 - 9) require periodic cleaning due to normal usage and spillage of food and drinks. This issue has resulted in multiple calls to the building contracted cleaners and carpet companies more often than wanted. We have put in place a comprehensive proactive carpet cleaning plan to ensure the spaces are kept in the upmost conditions. While funding requests for carpet cleaning increased, the carpet's appearance and odor(s) have not improved with these standard periodic spot cleanings. There have been several walk-throughs conducted to identify and confirm that a more extensive cleaning program is necessary to help prevent mold and mildew growth, remove deep-seated pollutants, restore the appearance of carpets, and possibly extend the life of the carpet, therefore decreasing long-term expenses. Approval is requested to have the RRB carpet steam cleaned bi-annually (twice a year) to improve appearance and remove odors.",2/12/2025,https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7200&PIID=7200AA24P00052&modNumber=0&idvAgencyID=&idvPIID=&contractType=AWARD,145549.0,2025-02-12,7200,7200AA24P00052,0,,,,05/21/2024,05/20/2024,05/19/2025,05/19/2025,,145549.0,,145549.0,,145549.0,,GDN6B8U9LM85,"LITTLE RIVER GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING, LLC",,87DZ3,2608 GOVERNMENT CENTER DR,,MANISTEE,MI,496608302,USA,UNITED STATES,(231) 299-5249,,MICHIGAN 02,4940,MISCELLANEOUS MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR SHOP SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT,561740.0,CARPET AND UPHOLSTERY CLEANING SERVICES,,2025-03-11-0948

The Activity will also seek collaboration with other development partners, civil society, and the Government of Uganda (GOU) to address other constraints to the agriculture market system.

The performance objectives of the activity are to (1) Increase research and analysis for use by, and about the media sector and business environment, for the primary use and benefit of decision making by media operations (2) Alleviate political, financial, and legal pressures on media houses and journalists that publish news and investigative reports (3) Increase financial independence and viability of local and national media. IIM will expand on USAID Burma’s current and past investments in the media sector, while working closely to align activities with other donor support that follow similar priorities. IIM will be managed by USAID Burma s Office for Democracy, Governance, and Humanitarian Assistance (DGHA) as part of a broader portfolio supporting democracy, governance, conflict mitigation, and resilience activities designed to protect human rights, advance the democratic transition, and support peace in Myanmar.",3/1/2025,https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7200&PIID=72048220C00002&modNumber=P00006&idvAgencyID=&idvPIID=&contractType=AWARD,20651095.0,2025-03-01,7200,72048220C00002,P00006,,,,01/08/2025,08/11/2020,08/10/2025,08/10/2025,04/26/2020,0.0,20651095.0,0.0,20651095.0,0.0,20651095.0,KA5HQCLKUVW1,DOMESTIC AWARDEES (UNDISCLOSED),FEDERAL EGOV IAE INITIATIVE - GENERIC DUNS,3JEH0,1800 F ST NW,,WASHINGTON,DC,204050001,USA,UNITED STATES,(703) 605-2175,,DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 98,R499,SUPPORT- PROFESSIONAL: OTHER,541990.0,"ALL OTHER PROFESSIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNICAL SERVICES",,2025-03-11-0948

USAID,"The purpose of this activity Request to obligated up to $601,517.60 in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Operating Expenses to support the Office of the Chief Economist (OCE) execution of training and events through a Call Order under World Wide Training Services (WWTS). The funding described in the request would fund a Call Order to the World Wide Training Services, a contract held by EnCompass (Contract # 7200AA22A00006). The Call Order will provide services to support OCE’s execution of Training for Cost-Effectiveness. Depending on final details of the training arrangement and cost, additional support may be possible for events such as an online version of the Cost-Effectiveness Training, Economist Revitalization Training, and/or an OCE Planning Retreat The decision to use the WWTS mechanism followed a series of deliberations considering other potential buy-in mechanisms such as Innovative Design, Execution and Acceleration Services (IDEAS) and Private Sector Engagement Modernization Contract (PSEMC). With the Approval of OCE Leadership, the REQ has been amended to add additional obligation of FY24 OE to WWTS up to the “New Obligation Total” of $601,517.60. On July 19, 2024, you approved the Action Memo and Pre-Obligation Checklist for WWTS (Tab 1). The POC obligated $385,668.04 in FY 24 OE funds. This increases that approved amount from $385,668.04 to the amount noted in the table above. The change is the result of 1) a decision not to pursue an additional OE funded ISC staff person; 2) savings on the travel budget; and 3) other OE budgets which allowed funds to be transferred to previously identified needs for Agency-wide training that were not yet funded.

USAID,"This is an annual Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order with Greenleaf to provide Professional development through coaching for USAID Jordan staff. * Objectives of the Coaching Program: Provide individual and team coaching to support USAID/Jordan staff to achieve the following: 1. Capitalize on Mission strengths to empower leadership to further the USAID assistance in alignment with US assistance objectives; 2. Supporting staff in coping with situational uncertainty that includes but are limited to work-life balance, stress management, time management, professional skills, supervision skills, leadership skills, communication, resilience, coaching between supervisor and employee to resolve issues or between co-workers, and problem-solving * Purpose and Nature of Coaching: Coaching is an ongoing, confidential, one-on-one partnership between an individual referred to as “Client” and a coach to identify, prioritize, and achieve the individual’s desired goals. The purpose of the coaching engagement is to help maximize individuals' potential and enhance their personal and professional effectiveness. Coaching is not psychological counseling, mentoring, therapy, or specialist advice, and the coach doesn't tell the client what to do. Instead, the coach asks the questions and uses exercises that enable the client to find answers. The client is responsible for any actions taken by the client/coach. Therefore, the client enters coaching with the complete understanding that they are accountable for their progress. * Confidentiality: Because coaching is developmental, information shared in the coach/client relationship must not be used for performance-based actions; therefore, the client is not assigned a coach within their reporting chain. A formal coaching agreement between the coach and client documenting the client’s desired outcomes is required. The agreement will only be shared between the coach and the client. All conversations between the coach and client are confidential, except in the following instances: - Information is provided to the coach by the client with the explicit purpose of the discussion with others; - Information shared by the client indicates a law or policy has been or is about to be broken; or - The client’s safety, or that of another, is in danger. * Frequency & Duration: The structure of sessions is centered around the client’s content, goals, and commitment to a coaching relationship. In general, extended programs should meet less frequently (1 to 2 times/month) than short programs (3 to 6 times/month). * Delivery Method: Coaching is done through VoIP-based audio or video calls. * Coaching Structure: 1. An initial discovery session is required between the coach and the client to discuss the client’s goals and to ensure that the pairing of client and coach is suitable. 2. If the discovery session is not a good match, for any reason, the client might ask for the services of another coach. Before the session begins, there should be a complimentary discovery session to establish the coaching relationship. 3. Once the coach is assigned, finalize the coaching agreement to include frequency, duration, delivery method, and confidentiality is required. 4. A coaching package is 3 sessions (1 session = 1 hour). Additional packages may be requested if needed. 5. A closing session is recommended once the coaching relationship is finalized. At the end of the coaching relationship, the coach is required t",3/1/2025,https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7200&PIID=72027824P00035&modNumber=0&idvAgencyID=&idvPIID=&contractType=AWARD,125000.0,2025-03-01,7200,72027824P00035,0,,,,03/28/2024,03/28/2024,03/31/2025,03/31/2025,,125000.0,,125000.0,,125000.0,,KB31L9YASF31,GREENLEAF INTEGRATIVE STRATEGIES LLC,,55XB2,3033 WILSON BLVD STE 700,,ARLINGTON,VA,222013868,USA,UNITED STATES,(917) 405-3316,(202) 670-7790,VIRGINIA 08,U008,EDUCATION/TRAINING- TRAINING/CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT,611430.0,PROFESSIONAL AND MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT TRAINING,,2025-03-11-0948

USAID,"While USAID’s Regional Mission in Ukraine (USAID/Ukraine) relies on its own translation team to handle its routine translation and interpretation needs, the volume of these assignments varies greatly from day to day, and may not always be expeditiously addressed due to both time and capacity constraints. With these considerations in mind, USAID/Ukraine plans to continue using services of external vendors to tackle this “overflow” of translation and interpretation work at a level of quality that should meet the expectations of its internal customers. The two vendors that USAID/Ukraine has used for that purpose in the recent years have been: Mr. Dmytro Shkryoba, a freelance interpreter/translator; and TRIS translation agency. Having monitored their performance during that time (also using feedback from internal Mission customers), our conclusion is that both vendors have performed their assignments successfully. In the last two weeks, together with the Senior Procurement Agent here at the Mission, we have done market research using quotes from several local providers of translation/interpretation services to see if the rates that the current vendors are offering to continue their work for USAID/Ukraine are competitive on the local market. Based on the analysis, and on the knowledge of their past performance, it appears that the two current vendors are offering the best value for the money that the Mission is willing to expend on these services. Therefore, I would recommend that the contracts with both Mr. Shkryoba and TRIS be renewed or extended, as the case may be, using the rates they are offering for the new/extended contract period.",3/1/2025,https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7200&PIID=72012119P00028&modNumber=P00014&idvAgencyID=&idvPIID=&contractType=AWARD,54712.0,2025-03-01,7200,72012119P00028,P00014,,,,12/09/2024,09/30/2019,09/30/2025,09/30/2025,,374.09,48191.69,374.09,54712.94,374.09,54712.94,KA5HQCLKUVW1,DOMESTIC AWARDEES (UNDISCLOSED),FEDERAL EGOV IAE INITIATIVE - GENERIC DUNS,3JEH0,1800 F ST NW,,WASHINGTON,DC,204050001,USA,UNITED STATES,(703) 605-2175,,DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 98,R408,SUPPORT- PROFESSIONAL: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT/SUPPORT,541990.0,"ALL OTHER PROFESSIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNICAL SERVICES",,2025-03-11-0948

USAID,"Request for Sole Source Award to the National Organization for Victim Advocacy (NOVA) BACKGROUND: USAID seeks to complete this non-competitive action in support of its stated goals of advancing respectful, inclusive, and safe workplaces by advancing trauma-informed investigations and support services for members of USAID’s workforce who have been impacted by sexual misconduct within or in connection to USAID’s workplace or facilities. Services include the development of a customized trauma-informed investigations training program for USAID personnel as well as training and credentialing support for USAID personnel providing support to individuals impacted by sexual misconduct. This action will support goals outlined in the USAID’s Three-Year Plan for Preventing and Responding to Sexual Misconduct and Workplace Violence, as well as new requirements included in Automated Directives System 113, Preventing and Addressing Sexual Misconduct, which states: USAID staff responsible for conducting inquiries or investigations into sexual misconduct will complete mandatory training related to empathic and/or trauma-informed investigative practices on a recurring basis, not to exceed 3 years between successive trainings, to ensure that personnel remain well-prepared and up-to-date in addressing the complexities of sexual misconduct cases while placing importance on the well-being of all involved parties, with a particular focus on reducing potential harm or re-traumatization for impacted persons while maintaining the integrity of the investigation. Such training may include content related to concepts such as: informed consent and empowerment, psychological safety, privacy and confidentiality, empathy, self-awareness, personal self-care, and resilience. SPECIFIC TO THE REQUIREMENT: USAID intends to procure support services to advance efforts to prevent and effectively respond to sexual misconduct while providing trauma-informed investigations and support to individuals impacted by such issues. Services will first and foremost consist of the development and delivery of a virtual 12-hour customized trauma-informed investigations training for USAID personnel who conduct inquiries and investigations into sexual misconduct incidents. At a secondary level, the services will support the enrollment and participation in NOVA’s Victim Assistance Academy (NVAA) for select USAID personnel, as well as additional support to secure related credentials for those personnel through the National Advocate Credentialing Program (NACP). These services will strategically augment efforts under USAID’s Impacted Person Support pilot program to expand the availability of victim/survivor/impacted person-centered and trauma-informed investigations and support services as a means of better empowering and supporting impacted persons in the wake of harmful incidents, reducing the potential for secondary harm or trauma as a result of engaging with Agency systems and processes, and decreasing potential organizational and reputational risks to the agency as a result of failing to fulfill its basic responsibilities and/or duty of care of individuals impacted by such issues. Specific objectives included under this award include: The development of a customized training for USAID that will be delivered virtually and then recorded for future use. This process will include: Subject Matter Expert recruitment.
